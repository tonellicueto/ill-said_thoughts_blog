<p style="white-space: nowrap;"> 
Only us,<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;with no other<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;or with others,<br/>
can project the <span id="colors" style="font-weight: bold;color:#ee2523;" onclick="ColorChange()">colors</span><br/>
onto the lived images<br/>
of our experience
</p>
<p style="white-space: nowrap;">
World's colorless<br/>
without our active sight

The original version of this poem was sent through two series: a first one of four postcards on April 30th of 2025, and a second one (numbered from II-α to II-ξ) of 14 postcards on August 20th of 2025. Each postcard depicted a colorless scene of Paris that could be colored, letting the person receiving the postcard whether or not E wants to project Eir colors onto it. Hence the poem-postcard plays on the idea on how our subjectivity (metaphorized as <i>color projection</i>) shapes our experiences, being the participatory element just an extra emphasis on our active role at experiencing the world and constructing our experience. The present on-line version add a twist randomizing the coloring of the word &ldquo;colors&rdquo; in the poem.
