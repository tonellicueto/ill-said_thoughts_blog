A first version of this text was sent through 20 postcards from the city of Madison-Wisconsin on July 12th of 2025. The present version of the text is a rework of the original raw hand-written fragmented text.

When one enters a capitol in the US (or some state building elsewhere), one finds the confrontation with the mythology of the most modern god: the State. As with any god, we praise Em with mysterious rites full of details and that we don't always understand by which we hope Eir favor. In the case of the State: the bureaucratic procedure. We approach the bureaucrat's desk and fill the forms with the same hope, non-understanding and detail-attention a Christian burns a candle and chants a prayer. Of course, there are differences, as the Christian god is supposed to be a personal forgiving god, while the State is nothing more than an impersonal machine-like unforgiving god.

However, I don't aim to focus on the rite—on how we relate with the State—, but on the mythology of this god. As we enter these US capitols (and these other state building), i.e., the _temples_ of this god, the images, forged in the feverish dream of the French Revolution, reach of eyes. Greek-Roman-like images showcase the promises of this new god (liberty, equality, justice, prosperity...) together with its ontology (government, legislation, treaties) and the saints (the national heroes). These symbols and images are twisted reimagining of those of Antiquity, they are not the Greek-Roman gods depicted but an abstracter more "universal" version of them.







The State as a religion has a simple rite, the bureaucracy, by which in a transcendental process that no one understands very specific procedures are done with the the hope of getting something. However, I don't want to focus on the rite—on the bureaucracy—of the State, but in its mythology.

This mythology, since the birth of the comptemporary State with the French reolution, has brought back to us the lost Greek and Roman symbols reinterpreted as symbols and myths of the State. However, this Greek/Roman mythology is not a real reproduction of the past, but a reimagination of Antiquity, where symbols and structures are re-utilized in new ways. By doing so, the State claims Its roots into the foundation of Western civilization, making Itself not a new instrument with which society articulates itself, but a transcendental entity going back to the essence of Western civilization itself. Was the current State a Greek/Roman construct?

It definitely wasn't, the Ancient Greek State or the Ancient Roman State are definitely not our State, lacking in many aspects the guarantees that our contemporary State has—no matter how imperfect it is.

However, by reimagining the past, the State justifies itself as transcendental and more importantly inevitable and natural. The latter is not different to what we do.

As the ego of the nation, the State needs to pick the naturally fragmented and multinarrated national identity and present it in a unified way in its mythology. The latter is precisely the same thing our ego does when we tell ourselves our story when answering the question of who we are. We conveniently retell or even forget events of our life to wake the past—I consistent with the future-I that we aim to live I. In other words, we can only visualize the future in the tradition of our past andd to imagine a different future we need to reimagin our past as to make the future we want realistic. The State when it shows its mythology and story is no different and so reimagines the past as to construct a myth that justifies its rites—the buraucracy—because until now it's different to find an alternative to this.

Can we indeed answer the question of who we are without answer the question of who we were? To say who we are, we need to say who we were and, in view of the contradictions of who we were, we can just reimagine who we were, so that we can project the image into the future. Maybe the only solutions is to resolve the fragmented self not by telling a unique story about ourseles, but a multistory fall of irresolved contradiction.
