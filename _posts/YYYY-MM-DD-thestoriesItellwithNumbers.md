At some moment or other in our lives, we encounter that theoretical construct from mathematics that is the joy of some and the terror of others: the numbers. In what some will consider a prophecy of my future path into mathematics, but it was only the fascination of a child for the numbers he has just learnt, I did the following drawing depicting numbers and mathematical operations as characters in a story.


By looking at the picture, we can see that the depicted scene is kind of far from mathematics. It has the mathematical characters, but it lacks the mathematical narrative. Are there though stories in mathematics? Is there a narrative in mathematics?

# Proofs as Stories

# Parameterized Stories

# Mechanistic Perspective



"It matters which stories we tell to tell other stories with; it matters what concepts we think to think other concepts."
